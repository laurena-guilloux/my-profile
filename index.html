	<h2>English</h2>
		<p>
	I'm fluent in English and I really like speaking this language while perfecting my accent, watching videos and films in English : living with the language on a daily basis.

  <h2>Harry Potter</h2>
	<p>I read the Harry Potter books a dozen time in french and recently finished reading it for the first time in english. I've been reading Harry Potter endlessly for years now, I always have an HP book in progress, because the Harry Potter world is my safe place. I feel like I know the characters like people in the real world, I know what's coming because I know the series by heart, and I can always go back in time in this world, just by going back to the first book or film. It feels like home to me and I could read or watch Harry Potter over and over.</p>

  <h2>Quality time</h2>
	<p>I recently realised that relationships with people is what my life is based on. I am really close to my family and am someone who likes to create one-to-one friendships, and I recently realised that I do not need to do anything to spend quality time, I just need to be surrounded by the right people.</p>

  <h2>Modeling</h2>
	<p>I really like watching fashion shows on my phone, I never had the chance to attend one but it's one of the things I would really love to experience. I'm considering trying to model myself, because I love it and I only have one life to give it a try.</p>

 <div class="card-white">
  <h2>Housing</h2>
	<p>By "housing", I mean two things. First, I really like searching for houses and appartments on estate agencies'websites, according to specific criterias.
	Then, I like even more designing the inside of a house : selecting furniture, choose colours and materials...</p>
